description: Eduardo Ryo Tamaki — Data Scientist & Gen AI Engineer
---

Data Scientist and Gen AI Engineer with a strong background in quantitative methods, causal inference, and machine learning. I build LLM-powered systems and work at the intersection of generative AI and applied data science.

My work spans developing generative AI frameworks, building RAG systems, and applying large language models to solve complex real-world problems. I bring a rigorous, research-driven approach to engineering — grounded in years of work with statistical methods and experimental design.

Previously, I worked in academic research at institutions including GIGA (German Institute for Global and Area Studies), the CEU Democracy Institute, and the University of Erfurt, where I developed novel AI-driven methodologies and taught courses on AI and quantitative methods.

## What I Do

- **Generative AI & LLMs** — Building and deploying LLM-based applications, from prompt engineering to full pipeline orchestration
- **Data Science** — Causal inference, machine learning, and statistical modeling applied to real business problems
- **AI Education** — Teaching intensive AI courses covering transformers, LLMs, prompt engineering, and API implementation

## Selected Highlights

- **Best Early Career Paper Award**, MethodsNET Conference 2024 — for "Chrono-Sampling," a generative AI framework for simulating historical public opinion
- **3rd Place**, HUN-REN AI1Science Hackathon — developed the Zeus Protocol for automating experimental research with LLMs
- **AI Course Instructor**, MethodsNET Summer School at CEU Vienna — "Artificial Intelligence: From Theory to Practice"
