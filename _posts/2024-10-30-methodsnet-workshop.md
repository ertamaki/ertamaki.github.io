Last week, I had the pleasure of leading a session at the 2024 MethodsNET Workshop on Research Methods Teaching Community of Practice. Focused on “Technological Advances & Research,” the workshop aimed to guide scholars and researchers through process- and pedagogy-oriented conversations on integrating the latest technological breakthroughs into our research practices.

During our two 3-hour sessions, we delved into a range of cutting-edge topics—from Generative AI, LLMs, and Transformers to the potential of text generation and content analysis. We explored how these innovations are reshaping both quantitative and qualitative research, while also addressing critical issues of transparency and ethics, such as user privacy and the handling of sensitive data.

The highlight of our time together was a hands-on “Interacting with AI” session. This practical exercise not only offered participants a chance to engage directly with AI tools but also sparked dynamic discussions on best practices for harnessing these tools effectively in research.

Overall, the workshop was an incredibly rewarding experience. I’m excited to see how these technological advances will continue to transform research methodologies and look forward to many more opportunities to explore these intersections in the future.
