Last week, I attended the 3rd MethodsNET Summer School in Social Science Research Methods (3SRM), one of Europe’s largest PhD-level methods schools to date. Having participated in the 2nd edition, I eagerly anticipated this year’s installment—and it certainly exceeded my expectations!

This year, I took part in the “AI for Political Analysis” course taught by [Prof. Dr. Ethan Busby](https://ethanbusby.com). Over five intensive days, we engaged in vibrant discussions about the applications of AI in political analysis (and beyond), culminating in a presentation on our final day about integrating AI into our research endeavors.

It was during that presentation that the idea for the [Chrono-sampling paper](https://ertamaki.github.io/2024-08-27-chrono-sampling/) was born. I decided then to shift my focus toward exploring how AI can advance Public Opinion Research. In fact, on a rainy afternoon while waiting for the bus, I found myself in an inspiring conversation with my good friend Levi (Levente Littvay) about using AI to create and study counterfactual scenarios — a concept that later evolved into the [Generative Counterfactual Framework](https://ertamaki.github.io/2025-01-15-job-market-paper/). We even mused: what if we could go back in time and survey people? The rest, as they say, is (unironically) history.

Overall, the course was amazing, and I can’t recommend next year’s summer school enough—even if you don’t sign up for the same track. It's an opportunity to gain fresh insights and engage with like-minded researchers that you really shouldn’t miss!
